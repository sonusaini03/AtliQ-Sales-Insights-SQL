--  If two items have same expense then row_number doesnt work. We need a true rank for which we need to use either a rank or dense_rank() function.(demo using student_marks table)
	select 
	     *,
             row_number() over (order by marks desc) as row_num,
             rank() over (order by marks desc) as rank_num,
             dense_rank() over (order by marks desc) as dense_rank_num
	from random_tables.student_marks;
